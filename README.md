<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Developers of the meta protocol ord-20 can integrate this indexer in the code according to their needs.

Once the indexer is started and connected to a local luckinals server, it will process each block one by one and populate the postgreSQL database with a detailed list of all token information, holder balances, and inscription transfer history.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Ord20 Indexer and its prerequisites can be installed from the command line.

### Prerequisites
1. Install Rust and its Dependencies
    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
    This project is developed with rust and can be built from source.

    ```sh
   # Linux dependencies
    sudo apt install libpq-dev libssl-dev
    ```

2. Install PostgreSQL
* PostgreSQL (Linux)
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client
  ```
  Start PostgreSQL CLI as the `postgres` user
  ```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  ```
  Modify the PostgreSQL password
  ```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  \password
  
  # Set a unique password and modify .env otherwise set to 'password'
  ```
* PostgreSQL (Mac)
  ```sh
  brew install postgresql
  ```
  Start the server:
  ```
  brew services start postgresql
  ```

3. Install Diesel
    ```sh
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo and build the binary
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/blackluv/lky20-indexer.git
   cd lky20-indexer
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Download Luckycoinv2 core v2 from github
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/luckycoin-community/luckycoin.git

    follow instructions on build per your configuration
    ```

3. Edit the `litecoin.conf` file of the full node
    ```
    cd ~/.luckycoin
    vi luckycoin.conf
    ```
    Add the following configurations and save
    ```
    txindex=1
    rpcserialversion=1
    ```

5. Run the Luckycoin full node until it is fully synchronised 

6. Clone the ordinals repo and build the ord server.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/blackluv/ord-luckycoin.git
    cd ord-luckycoin
    cargo build --release
    ```

7. Run the ordinals server, and allow it to fully synchronise.
    ```
    ./ord server -j
    ```

8. Configure the lky20-indexer in your `.env` file.
    ```
    # The ordinals metaprotocol to index (brc-20, ltc-20, drc-20)
    META_PROTOCOL=lky-20
    
    # Starting index block height
    START_BLOCK=0
    
    # How many blocks to stay behind to reduce the impact of block reorganisations (0 = disabled, 6 = recommended)
    BLOCKS_BEHIND=6
    
    # The ordinals server address (https://ordinals.com/, https://ordinalslite.com/, http://localhost/)
    ORDINALS_BASE_URL=http://localhost/
    
    # The postgres database credentials and url
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost/ord20-indexer
    ```

9. Create database and then run the database installation scripts
    ```
    sudo -u postgres -p password createdb ord20-indexer
    diesel migration run
    ```

10. Run the lky-20 indexer
    ```
    ./target/release/ord20-indexer
    ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Extend the application to cover multiple ordinal meta protocols.
- [ ] Index directly from full nodes using the binary data found in blocks and transactions

See the [open issues](https://github.com/blackluv/lky20-indexer/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
